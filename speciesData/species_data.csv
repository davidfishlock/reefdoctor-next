The zooanthid polyps close."
Caulastrea,Coral,NA,2,"Phaceloid.~Fleshy walls with septa of alternating prominence and colour, and the phaceloid character give the corallites an appearance of vases.~Paliform lobes are not noticeable.~Tentacles are rarely extended during the day."
Cycloseris,Coral,NA,2,"All of the Fungidae can move to some extent, but Cycloseris are particularly known for being able to right themselves if overturned and being able to move over obstacles. This ability also makes them able to extract themselves from sediment, making them very successful in areas of high sedimentation where others may not survive.~Solitary.~Usually don''t grow larger than 8cm.~Septa have fine teeth and the underside is almost smooth."
Diploastrea,Coral,NA,2,"Massive and dome shaped, attaining huge sizes (up to 2m high and 5m across) due to its very dense skeleton which is rarely attacked by boring organisms or grazed by fish.

Coral Submassive - CS,Benthic,Expert,3,'Sub-' is a prefix meaning 'less' or 'not quite'.~Not quite the boulder-like mass of a massive coral.
Halimeda - HA,Benthic,Expert,3,"Halimeda is a green algae that excretes a calcium carbonate ''skeleton'', which makes it difficult to digest by many herbivores and so serves as protection from many algae-eating organisms."
Millepora - MI,Benthic,Expert,3,"Fire coral is not a real hard coral, but a hydroid. It nevertheless builds a skeleton, so contributes to the reef formation.~Can be recognised by smooth, flattened branches and covering of fine hairs (nematocysts)."
Other (Clam) - OC,Benthic,Expert,3,"Clams are sessile molluscs. They filter-feed small animals from the water and, like corals contain zooxanthellae algae with which they share a ''food-sharing'' symbiotic relationship.~If the transect covers the fleshy part of the clam it is classed as OC. If the transect covers the shell then the classification will be rock (RCN or RCC)."
Rock (with Coralline Algae) - RCC,Benthic,Expert,3,"Coralline algae is a photosynthetic marine plant with calcareous skeleton.~May exhibit different growth forms including encrusting and branching. Often looks like lichen.~Hard algae covering the surface of old/dead coral. Can be smooth or bumpy, but always rounded.~Colors vary from pink/purple to white and yellow."
Seagrass - SG,Benthic,Expert,3,"Seagrasses are flowering plants that mostly occur in large meadows. They provide nurseries, shelter and food to a variety of marine species. They are not common on reefs but are around, so you might come across them if a part of your transect is led over sand.~Some of the species around in Ifaty are: Halodule uninervis, Thalassia hemprichii, Syringodium isoetifolium."
Sponge - SP,Benthic,Expert,3,"Stiff tissue with a skeleton similar to that of soft corals but with a matrix of hard elements called spicules.~Patterns of these spicules can often be seen from the surface like splinters in the tissue or irregular lumps over the surface.~Sponges can be encrusting, small protruding structures, or massive, stocky structures securely attached to the bottom."

Physogyra,Coral,NA,3,"Colonies are encrusting to massive and meandroid with short valleys.~Only one species in this genus (P. lictensteini).~Colonies are meandroid, although, like Plerogyra, this is hard to distinguish as they are covered throughout the day by the small grape-like vesicles distinctive to this genus. "
African White Spotted Rabbitfish,Fish,Indicator,4,"Can grow to 50cm~Oval shaped~Small terminal mouths~Target species for the artisanal fishery~Grazers/detritivores~Play an important role in coral reef resilience by  - intensely grazing on the epilithic algal matrix, which can limit the establishment and growth of macroalgae."

Feather Seastar,Invertebrate,NA,4,
Ornate Spiny Lobster,Invertebrate,NA,4,
Dead Coral - DC,Benthic,Indicator,4,"Killed during the last year. This means that corallites will not be very eroded and you can tell which genus it belongs to. If the corallites have been eroded down and are covered in encrusting organisms or coralline algae, then it is classified as rock.~The skeleton may still be white if very recently killed because it is made out of limestone. It may be slightly overgrown by algae as this may not take long to settle. Look under the algae for corallites that are not eroded and/or whiteish skeleton."
Sand - SD,Benthic,Indicator,4,"Sand is a natural component of coral reefs. This category helps us to see when the transect hits a sandy patch in-between the reef area. If you are unsure as to whether it is sand or silt, pick a bit up and drop it. If it falls straight to the ground, it is sand. If it forms a cloud in the water column, it is silt.~Sand doesn''t provide us with much information on a survey - so we try to avoid sand on the surveys. However it will still happen that we come across some patches of sand."
Acropora Branching - ACB,Benthic,Expert,4,"The most common coral genus in the Western Indian Ocean. ~Acropora can be easily identified by the distinctive protruding, cup-like corallites and ''axial'' growing points.~From the base the stem branches off into secondary stems.~Note axial corallites on branch tips."

Long-legged Spiny Lobster,Invertebrate,NA,5,
Phyllidia Nudibranch,Invertebrate,NA,5,
Ascidian - AS,Benthic,Expert,5,"Ascidians (or tunicates or sea squirts) can easily be confused with encrusting sponges because of their irregular growth. They are also filter feeders and so are covered in inhalant and exhalent holes.~However, they are much more complex organisms than sponges and the holes will CLOSE if you waft your hand over them. Sponges will not do this!~Ascidians also tend to have a more shiny surface than sponges (which are matt/dull colored).~Can be solitary or colonial."

Acanthastrea,Coral,NA,14,"Massive to encrusting with ceroid or subplocoid corallites.~The most common distinguishing feature is the tall septal teeth, giving the walls a sharp, bumpy appearance.~Thick fleshy walls.~Corallite shapes range from circular to large and elongated, often having different coloured walls and calices.~Tentacles are only extended at night."
Goniastrea,Coral,NA,14,"Massive or encrusting forming thick plates.~Corallites are cerioid to meandroid, with cerioid corallites generally quite small, 3.5mm - 10mm.~Commonly called honeycomb corals due to the angular shape of the colonies with cerioid corallites.~Well developed paliform crown visible underwater (Favities doesn''t have this).~Fine, neat septa."
Hydnophora,Coral,NA,14,"Colonies are massive, branching or encrusting to submassive.~Colonies are cerioid and almost uniquely, common walls intersect, thicken and form prominent conical mounds called monticules or hydnophores.~Tentacles will be extended from around the base of the monticules and the polyps in the pseudo valleys."
Leptoseris,Coral,NA,14,Colonies are laminar (unifacial) or encrusting.~Corallites are small shallow depressions.~Interconnected by fine septo-costae.
Mycedium,Coral,NA,14,Colonies are encrusting to laminar.~Lines formed by the costae radiating outward from the centre are distinct. ~Corallites are usually large (up to 15mm in diameter).~Corallites form a nose like shape which faces towards the exterior of the colony.
Platygyra,Coral,NA,14,"Colonies are massive, ranging from flat to large and dome-shaped.  ~Most species are meandroid with valleys of varying lengths.~Famously known as the large massive domes of ''brain coral'' due to the convoluted valleys of mature colonies.~Paliform lobes are usually not developed.~Tentacles are only extended at night."
Porites,Coral,NA,14,"Porites shows enormous variety within the genus, displaying encrusting, laminar-branching, simple branching, submassive and massive growth forms.~Corallites are extremely small (1-1.5mm) and cerioid.~Corallites are small, immersed and filled with septa and other structures.~At a distance, massive colonies can take on a smooth, velvety appearance."
Psammocora,Coral,NA,14,"Colonies are massive, submassive, laminar, or encrusting.~Calices are very small 1-2 mm in diameter.~Corallites are immersed, small and shallow, sometimes forming a valley.~Calice forms a distinctive black pit.~Septo-costae have granulated/serrated margins, which resolves any possible confusion with Pavona which have smooth (or at least only minutely ridged) septo-costae."
Algae - AG,Benthic,Indicator,15,"Algae can be green, red or brown in colour but for indicator survey you do not need to differentiate.~Turf algae is a fast growing algae frequently covering rock. For the survey you only record AG when your tape comes across turf algae if the algae is more than a few centimeters long.~Halimeda is a green algae that excretes a calcium carbonate ''skeleton'', which makes it difficult to digest by many herbivores and so serves as protection from many algae-eating organisms."
Ascidian - AS,Benthic,Indicator,15,"Solitary, social, and colonial ascidians exist. Solitary ascidians are often easier to recognize as they look like little bells. These solitary ascidians can occur in groups but their tissue is not joined (similar to the zoanthids).~Look for two holes: an inhalant and exhalant aperture."
Hard Coral - HC,Benthic,Indicator,15,"Calcium carbonate skeleton that will not move when wafted.~Visible corallites (the skeleton deposited by each polyp). Polyps are mostly out at night, therefore only corallites are visible during the day.~A sandpaper-like or knobby surface (all the corallites of the colony).~Polyps have 6 or multiple of 6 tentacles (EXCEPT: blue coral, and organ pipe coral which have 8, and fire coral which is ''fuzzy'' looking).~Different morphologies exist - encrusting hard corals are sometimes overlooked.~Hard corals that feed during the day exist. Don''t be thrown off by those that does and can look like soft corals at first glance."
Other - OT,Benthic,Indicator,15,"Hydroids are related to coral. They look like feathers or ferns and are often called stinging hydroids because they sting! DON''T TOUCH!~Gorgonians are actually soft corals but don''t come under the SC category. They are common in areas of high current where they position themselves against the current and filter out food from the water that travels across them.~Anemones are also related to coral. They frequently have anemone fish living in them, however, not always.~Any types of clams are counted as other, including the giant clam, boring clams or any other types. They are sessile so although they are invertebrates they are counted in the benthic section . The shell of the clam is counted as rock as it provides a surface for other organisms to grow on.~Also known as sea mats and lace corals, Bryozoans are unrelated to true corals. Colonies of independent units make up lace or sheet-like structures.~Seagrasses are not counted within the algae category as they are flowering plants rather than algae. The distribution is also different to algae as seagrass is usually found in meadows around reef systems but not on the reef itself. In this bay you can find eight species of seagrasses.~Tubastrea is a type of hard coral however it is not hermatipic as it does not have the mutualistic relationship with zooxanthellae. This means that Tubastrea can grow at depth as it does not require light.~Tubeworms are worm-like molluscs grow inside a shell tube, up to 15cm long, firmly cemented to live coral, dead coral or rock. They will retract if you come close."
Soft Coral - SC,Benthic,Indicator,15,"Soft corals do not build reefs as their skeleton is made from soft tissue that is supported internally by a matrix of individual calcareous elements.~Soft corals can be differentiated from hard corals by wafting the water column; soft corals'' superstructure will move. Many soft corals will also have their polyps out during the daytime and you can count their 8 tentacles (Octocorals).~Polyps always have 8 tentacles, which are hairy-looking.~Polyps are often day feeders.~Smooth texture with small, regular holes if polyps are retracted.~Surface of some soft corals can appear leathery or rubbery."
Sponge - SP,Benthic,Indicator,15,"Surface often matt or dull.~Simple organisms with no set shape. Think IRREGULAR!~Can assume a variety of shape and sizes from small encrusting animals to large tube, barrel foliose forms.~To tell these from hard corals, waft them, and they will sway. ~To tell them from soft corals, look closely at the surface for irregular texture, covered in different size holes. These hole will NOT close up if you waft your hand over them.~To tell them from ascidians perform the waft test again. The holes will close if it''s an ascidian. Ascidians also often tend to have a more shiny colorful surface."
Zooanthids & Corallimorphs - ZC,Benthic,Indicator,15,"Zoanthids are a small group of predominantly colonial, anemone-like forms (without a pedal disk) that are common on tropical reefs. They can potentially cover large areas and therefore be a competitor for space with reef-forming corals.~Corallimorphs are another small group closely related to the hard corals but lack a calcareous skeleton. Corallimorph tentacles are also generally in radial rows, more like an anemone."
Angelfish,FishFamily,NA,15,"Pomacanthidae: Round, laterally compressed, broader/larger~Spine on their gill operculum ~Shelter: rocks, boulders and coral crevices~Very colourful, huge juvenile variations~Diet: algae, sponge, benthic invertebrates or some feed on pelagic zooplankton"

Cyphastrea,Coral,NA,15,"Massive or encrusting.~The most common species, Cyphastrea serailia, is often sub-massive. ~Corallites are well spaced, plocoid, sometimes slightly conical and have a very small calice, <3mm.~Septa are well developed and form a characteristic star pattern visible underwater.~Coenosteum heavily granulated.~Tentacles are only extended at night."
Echinopora,Coral,NA,15,"Wide variety of growth forms from encrusting through foliaceous and branching.~Corallite are plocoid and calices average 10mm with walls often the same size.~Coenosteum, septa and costae are toothed, giving colonies a very granulated appearance.~Paliform lobes can be well developed in some species.~Corallites may be oriented at odd angles, giving the colony an untidy appearance.~Tentacles are only extended at night.~Most similar to Cyphastrea, which is differentiated by smaller corallites, thinner walls, massive growth form, neater corallite orientation."
Pavona,Coral,NA,15,"Colonies are massive, submassive, encrusting, laminar, or frond-like (bushes of flattened irregular branches).~Corallites have poorly defined walls and are small shallow depressions.~Prominent septo-costae that extend into distinctive patterns connecting the corallites."
